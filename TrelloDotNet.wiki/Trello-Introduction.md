## What is Trello

Trello is a web-based collaboration tool that allows teams or individuals to organize and track their work. The 3 main concepts are `Boards`, `Lists` and `Cards`

### Boards
A `Board` represents a "set of related work". That could be a project, a team, an event, or whatever tasks (Cards) you feel should be grouped together. You can create multiple boards and move work between them.

### Lists
Within each board, you can create multiple lists. A `List` usually represents different stages or areas of a project. You can example create the lists "Todo," "In Progress," and "Completed" to track the progress, but there are no hard limits to how and how many lists you have

### Cards
A `Card` normally represents a piece of work that one or more users (called `Members`) can work on. Each card must belong to a specific list. A Card can be as simple as a Name/Title, but you can include descriptions, labels (tags), checklists, attachments, dates, and comments for more control and categorization.

### Other Basic concepts
- `Labels` are Tags you can assign to cards for Categorization
- `Checklists` are lists inside cards with one or more check items for a further breakdown of what the work is about
- `Workspaces` are a Group of Boards and can as an example represent a department or categorization of boards. In the Trello API workspaces are called `Organizations`
- `Webhooks` can be set up against a Trello Board, so external systems can be notified about changes or you can use them to make [Automations](Automation-Engine) and other integrations
- `Power-Ups` are extensions that extend the Trello Board in various ways (Using the API is not considered a Power-Up, but a power-Up can consume the API)
