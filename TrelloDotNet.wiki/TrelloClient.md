This is the Main Client to communicate with the Trello API (aka everything is done via this)

## Creating a new TrelloClient
In order to instantiate the client you need to provide:
| Option | Description | 
|:---|:---|
| `ApiKey` (Required) | The Trello API Key you get on https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/ |
| `Token` (Required) | Your Authorization Token you generate get on https://trello.com/power-ups/admin/ |
| `Options` (Optional) | Various options for the client (if null default options will be used) See below for details |
| `HttpClient` (Optional) | Optional HTTP Client if you wish to specify it on your own (else an internal static HttpClient will be used for re-use) |

**Example**

```cs
TrelloClient client = new TrelloDotNet.TrelloClient("APIKEY", "TOKEN"); //IMPORTANT: Remember to NOT leave Key and Token in clear text!

//Get all boards that Token Owner can Access
List<Board> boards = await client.GetBoardsCurrentTokenCanAccessAsync();

//Get a specific board
Board board = await client.GetBoardAsync("<boardId>");

//Get Lists on a board
List<List> lists = await client.GetListsOnBoardAsync("<boardId>");

//Get Cards on Board
List<Card> cardsOnBoard = await trelloClient.GetCardsOnBoardAsync("<boardId>");

//Get Cards in a specific List
List<Card> cardsInList = await trelloClient.GetCardsInListAsync("<listId>");

//Get a specific card
Card card = await client.GetCardAsync("<cardId>");

//Add a card (Simple)
AddCardOptions newCardOptions = new AddCardOptions("<listId>", "My Card", "My Card description");
Card newCard = await client.AddCardAsync(newCardOptions);

//Add a Card (Advanced with all options set)
Card newAdvancedCard = await client.AddCardAsync(new AddCardOptions
{
    //Mandatory options
    ListId = "<listId>",
    Name = "My Card",

    //Optional options
    Description = "Description of My Card",
    Start = DateTimeOffset.Now,

        "<labelId2>",
    },
    MemberIds = new List<string>
    {

        "<memberId2>"
    },
    Checklists = new List<Checklist>
    {
        new Checklist("Checklist 1", new List<ChecklistItem>
        {
            new ChecklistItem("Item 1"),
            new ChecklistItem("Item 2"),

            new ChecklistItem("Item B"),
            new ChecklistItem("Item C")
        }),
    },
    AttachmentUrlLinks = new List<AttachmentUrlLink>
    {
        new AttachmentUrlLink("https://www.google.com", "Google")
    },
    AttachmentFileUploads = new List<AttachmentFileUpload>
    {
        new AttachmentFileUpload(File.OpenRead(@"<pathToFile>"), "<Filename>", "<FileDescription>")
    },
    CustomFields = new List<AddCardOptionsCustomField>
    {
        new AddCardOptionsCustomField(customField1OnBoard, "ABC"),
        new AddCardOptionsCustomField(customField2OnBoard, 123),
    }
});

//Update a Card (with new name and description and removal of Due Date)
var updateCard = await TrelloClient.UpdateCardAsync("<cardId>", [
    CardUpdate.Name("New Name"),
    CardUpdate.Description("New Description"),
    CardUpdate.DueDate(null),
]);

//Add a Checklist to a card
var checklistItems = new List<ChecklistItem>
{
    new("ItemA"),
    new("ItemB"),

### Action Features
`Actions` in Trello are the 'things' the `Members` do on a `Board`... There are common things like 'Create a Card' or 'Add a Label to a Card', and more obscure things like example 'Accept Enterprise Join Request'. In total, there are over 75 different types of `Actions`. You can retrieve these events via the API to example get a list of things that happened on a specific card. 

> Tip: There is a list of different events in struct [`TrelloDotNet.Model.Webhook.WebhookActionTypes`](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/blob/main/TrelloDotNet/TrelloDotNet/Model/Webhook/WebhookActionTypes.cs) for you to consume. 

> NB: You can max get the last 1000 Actions that have happened.
