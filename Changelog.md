#### Special
- **This is the first v2.x release. It has a set of breaking changes to streamline the API and make it less confusing to use (fewer options to do the same thing). [See a list of breaking changes here](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/issues/51)**

- Added .editorconfig to help with naming of public methods (all receive the Async suffix)

#### TrelloClient
- Added `FilterCondition` to `GetCardsOptions` that allows you to filter the cards returned in various ways (Example: _give me all cards on board that have the Red Label, 1-2 Members and the Description contains the word 'Urgent'_). NB: The filter is an in-memory filter as Trello does not allow server-side filtering. See more about the Filter Condition System [here](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/Filter-Condition-System)

- Added Extension Methods for `PlugInData` to cast their values to a Specific Model
- Fixed that a Custom Field of type Date could not be read if it included milliseconds
- Introduced an "Unknown" value for all enum-based values returned from the API to ensure that Trello can introduce new valid values without breaking this API (will revert to this Unknown value if value-parsing fails) [NB: You should never send this value to Add/Update methods as it will result in a failure]

<hr>

## 1.11.13 (4th of March 2025)

- Added [GetTokenMemberInboxAsync](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/GetTokenMemberInboxAsync) to get the IDs of the owner of the Token's Inbox
- Added `CardUpdate.Cover` to allow Cover updates and `CardUpdate.AdditionalParameter` to allow any additional fields that are not a known field (should something new come along)
- Change: `CardUpdate.DueDate` and `CardUpdate.StartDate` have been changed to be nullable in order to allow the removal of values
- Obsoleted `UpdateCardAsync(Card cardWithChanges...)` as it has performance issues and can cause data to be overwritten. Use one of the two other variants to update your cards as they are faster and safer.
