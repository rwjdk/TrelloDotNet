# Changelog 

## Unreleased (2.x previews)
#### Special
- **This is the first v2.x release. It has a set of breaking changes to streamline the API and make it less confusing to use (aka less options to do the same thing). [See a list of breaking changes here](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/issues/51)**
- Streamlined texts in ReadME, Changelog and Description of NuGet Package
- Introduced an "Unknown" value for all enum-based values returned from the API that ensure that Trello can introduce new Valid Values without breaking this API (will revert to this Unknown value, should value-parsing fail) [NB: You should never send this value to Add/Update Methods as it will result in a failure]
- Added .editorconfig to help with naming of public methods (that they all receive the Async suffix)

#### TrelloClient
- Added `FilterCondition` to `GetCardsOptions` that allow you to filter the cards returned in various ways (Example: _give me all cards on board that have the Red Label, 1-2 Members and the Description contains the word 'Urgent'_). NB: Please note that the filter is an In-Memory Filter as Trello's do not allow Server-side filtering. See more about the Filter Condition System [here](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/Filter-Condition-System)
- Added option to see the Board Prefrences of the `Board`
- Added [UpdateBoardPreferencesAsync](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/UpdateBoardPreferencesAsync) to update the various prefenrence of the board

- Added [GetTokenMemberInboxAsync](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/GetTokenMemberInboxAsync) to get the Ids of the owner of the Token's Inbox

- Change: `CardUpdate.DueDate` and `CardUpdate.StartDate` has been changed to be nullable in order to allow removal of value
- Obsoleted `UpdateCardAsync(Card cardWithChanges...)` as it have performance issues and overwritten data scenarios. Use one of the two other variants to update your cards as they are faster and more safe.
- Obsoleted `UpdateCardAsync(string cardId, List<QueryParameter> parameters...)`. User `UpdateCardAsync(string cardId, List<CardUpdate> valuesToUpdate)` version instead.
- Obsoleted `AddCardTemplateAsync()` (Use `AddCardAsync()` instead and in options set `IsTemplate = true` )

- Added [`GetTokenMemberAsync`](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/GetTokenMemberAsync) that returns the user that owns the Trello Token used for connecting
- Fixed that Null values in strings for an update of objects are now considered empty strings so you do not end up with 'null' values (aka the word 'null' as a string)

## Version 1.2.1 (25th of Feb. 2023)
#### TrelloClient
- Added [`UpdateCommentActionAsync`](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/UpdateCommentActionAsync) for the ability to update Comments
- Added [`GetAllCommentsOnCardAsync`](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/GetAllCommentsOnCardAsync) and [`GetPagedCommentsOnCardAsync`](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/GetPagedCommentsOnCardAsync) for the ability to Get existing comments on a card
- Updated [`AddChecklistAsync`](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/AddChecklistAsync) to now add positions of check items automatically in the same order as the list if none is specified.
- Fixed that [`AddStickerToCardAsync`](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/AddStickerToCardAsync) did not work as intended (You got an 'Invalid ImageId' error) due to a late refactoring and poor testing on my part (last time I skimp on integration-tests!) :-(
- Fixed that [`AddCommentAsync`](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/wiki/AddCommentAsync) had a wrong return object (Trello API is just weird and not consistent!)

#### Webhook Receiver
- Added generic WebHookNotification that does not care if Webhook returned from a Board, List, Card, etc
