In TrelloDotNet, there are two ways to react to Webhook Events from a Trello Board; 

- The [Automation Engine](Automation-Engine) that makes it easy to set up at a slight cost of Performance and Flexibility
- The [Webhook Data Reveiver](Webhook-Data-Receiver) that gives you more control, but you need to handle almost everything yourself

This page compares the two in various aspects for you to choose which is suitable for you:

> Owner Note: For personal preference and having made both I personally prefer the [Automation Engine](Automation-Engine) despite giving up a bit of control.
