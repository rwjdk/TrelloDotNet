| AdditionalParameters      | Send these additional parameters not supported out-of-the-box (should you need to do something to the query parameters not yet supported by this API).                                                     |
| BoardFields               | Specifies which board fields to include if `IncludeBoard` is set to `True`.                                                                                                                               |
