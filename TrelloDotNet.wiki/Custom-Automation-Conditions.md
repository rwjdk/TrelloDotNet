The [Automation Engine](Automation-Engine) has various [out-of-the box Conditions](Automation-Engine#conditions), but there can be  cases where you wish to make your own custom condition 

> If you think the Condition you need so be an out-of-the-box Condition feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/issues) or [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/rwjdk/TrelloDotNet/pulls) with your custom Condition

### Steps to make a custom Condition

1. Make a new C# class and Call it 'MyCustomCondition' (or what you like it to be called but it is recommended to suffix it 'Condition')
2. Let the class implement interface `IAutomationCondition`
3. Let the class implement the mandatory member `IsConditionMetAsync`

#### Basic Example
``` cs

//Your custom Condition
public class MyCustomCondition: IAutomationCondition
{
    public async Task<bool> IsConditionMetAsync(WebhookAction webhookAction)
    {
        //Your Logic if the Condition is met

        WebhookActionData webhookActionData = webhookAction.Data; //This object has data about the event
        TrelloClient trelloClient = webhookAction.TrelloClient; //If you need the TrelloClient to access data from Trello to evaluate your event you have access to it here

        return false; //Return true if the Condition is met (aka continue to Actions) or False if not met (stop processing)
    }
}
```

Inside the `IsConditionMetAsync` you have access to the WebhookAction (aka the JSON given by the Webhook) + The TrelloClient for further data lookups if needed
